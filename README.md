#  Ship Performance Analysis

This project analyzes the operational performance of a ship based on various engineering parameters such as engine power, fuel consumption, speed, and resistance. It uses Python and Jupyter Notebook for data analysis and visualization.

## File

- `Lab_Ship_Performance.ipynb` â€” main notebook containing the step-by-step analysis, plots, and conclusions.

## Objectives

- Evaluate key metrics that affect ship performance.
- Understand the relationships between speed, resistance, and power.
- Visualize performance parameters with respect to fuel efficiency and operational behavior.
- Apply basic engineering principles to interpret real-world data.

## ðŸ”§ Requirements

To run the notebook, install the following Python packages:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn jupyter
